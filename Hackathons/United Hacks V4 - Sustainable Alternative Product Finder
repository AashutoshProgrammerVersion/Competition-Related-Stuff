For this hackathon, I made an app called a sustainable product alternative finder that only works for Amazon Website (unfortunately not working fully so still in progress but he main idea is there)
To us it, you need to install all the necessarily modules and the in the terminal with the directory being folder containing the file, you must type "streamlit run <file_name>.py" to run the file, the name being whatever it is (make sure to change the file name after you download it)
The first version was what I coded during the hackathon but I updated it after the second version which was after the hackathon (still doesn't work all the time as Amazon blocks my requests)
