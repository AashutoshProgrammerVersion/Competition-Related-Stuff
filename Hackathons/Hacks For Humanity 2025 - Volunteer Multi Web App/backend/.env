EMAIL_PASS=//go to app passwords, type some app name (doesn't tend to matter what it is, it is simply the thing that will come up on the Email you send to someone) and then it will show you a generated password, it is usually 16 characters long with alpahabets but it can change ig (it was Feb 1 2025 then btw)
